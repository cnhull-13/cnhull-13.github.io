            In a nutshell, bundles up web applications into a mobile-usable
            form. While not the most efficient, this means basic web development
            experience is enough to put something together, and the same
            application can be used across multiple platforms.

            <h2 class="mar cordova">Cordova</h2>
            <p>
              Cordova primarily works in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, making it an
              easy transition for people who already have some web development
              experience.

            <h2 class="mar reactNative">ReactNative</h2>
            <p>
              React Native also works mostly in JavaScript, giving it many of
              the same benefits as Cordova. However, it does not use HTML and
              CSS to handle its layout.
            </p>

          <div class="col-sm-4 flutter-bg">
            <h2 class="mar flutter">Flutter</h2>
            <p>
              Flutter, developed by Google, uses a language called Dart, also
              developed by Google. It uses a system of "widgets" to create
              applications.

            <h2 class="mar cordova">Cordova</h2>
            <p>
              Because Cordova works primarily in JavaScript, it also has access
              to JavaScript's large library of third-party plugins and other
              add-ons.
            </p>

            <h2 class="mar reactNative">ReactNative</h2>
            <p>
              Just like Cordova, React Native also has access to JavaScript's
              large library of third-party plugins and other add-ons.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4 flutter-bg">
            <h2 class="mar flutter">Flutter</h2>
            <p>
              Flutter's library is more limited, with most add-ons coming
              directly from Google
            </p>

            <h2 class="mar cordova">Cordova</h2>
            <p>
              Because Cordova effectively packages a web app in a mobile
              wrapper, Cordova's performance may suffer with large, complicated
              applications. Most applications won't be affected.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4 reactNative-bg">
            <h2 class="mar reactNative">ReactNative</h2>
            <p>
              React Native has fairly high performance, outpacing Cordova, but
              falling short of Flutter's. Again, the difference won't be
              apparent on most applications.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4 flutter-bg">
            <h2 class="mar flutter">Flutter</h2>
            <p>
              Flutter supposedly peforms the closest to a fully native app, and
              is better able to handle large, complex apps that Cordova and
              React Native may struggle with.

            I'm still following the installation and setup guide. How am I
            supposed to know what any of these are or what they do?
          </li>
          <li>
            I picked what I thought was the default and finished "creating" a
            new virtual device. It gave me an error and did not create the
            device.
          </li>
          <li>
            I'm just going to keep going and hope it doesn't screw things up.
          </li>
          <li>Summarizing: I gave up. I spent some 8hrs troubleshooting, uninstalling and reinstalling several times, and cleaning up my C drive when it turned out that they had lied about how much space the Android Studio/SDK would take up (it was ~10+GB, they said 500MB during installation)</li>
          <li> When I was finally able to get Android Studio Running, nothing would run. The emulator alone made my computer nigh unusable.</li>
          <li> Their guide didn't provide any information on how to use Flutter without Android Studio, so I threw in the towel.</li>
