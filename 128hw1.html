            Hello! My name is Casey! I graduated from UCSC in 2021 with a double
            bachelor in Economics and Game Design. I also enjoy speculative
            fiction, crochet, and playing games of all kinds.

          <p>
            I decided to come back to school to work on my web development and
            computer science skills, so that I can hopefully pursue a career in
            a related field. It never hurts to have more skills!

              <dd>Glitch is a super convenient way to play around with making webpages and more! You don't even need an account to get started--just pop open one of the many starter templates and get straight to tinkering! They also allow for collaborative coding, and <em>live</em> updates! Definitely a great resource for getting instant feedback.</dd>
            <dt><a rel = "noopener noreferrer" target = "_blank" href = "https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp">W3 Schools</a></dt>
              <dd>The name everyone knows, and for good reason--W3 Schools has incredibly comprehensive guides on nearly everything there is to know about...well, everything? Certainly all of the major coding languages/scripts/etc. I would be remiss not to include them.</dd>
            <dt><a rel = "noopener noreferrer" target = "_blank" href = "https://stackoverflow.com/questions">StackOverflow</a></dt>
              <dd>And an honorable mention, since I'm sure most people are using W3 Schools: StackOverflow is where I go when W3 Schools fails me (as rare as it is.) Whenever I'm pondering funky uses or weird issues that I just can't seem to resolve on my own, the good folks who frequent StackExchange usually have you covered. Forums continue to be an infinitely valuable resource in an online world growing increasingly saturated by copycat AI articles. </dd>
