          Wild Life includes all non-domesticated plants, animals and other
          organisms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. Deserts, forests, rain
          forests, plains, grasslands, and other areas including the most
          developed urban sites, all have distinct forms of wildlife.

          Exploitation of wild populations has been a characteristic of modern
          man since our exodus from Africa 130,000 â€“ 70,000 years ago. The rate
          of extinctions of entire species of plants and animals across the
          planet has been so high in the last few hundred years it is widely
          believed that we are in the sixth great extinction event on this
          planet

          Anthropologists believe that the Stone Age people and hunter-gatherers
          relied on wildlife, both plants and animals, for their food. In fact,
          some species may have been hunted to extinction by early human
          hunters.

          health in the same reserve. Unfortunately vets could not save her.
